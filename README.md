CPIU is a Node.js interface for [CPI-U](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. CPI-U data are commonly used for calculating inflation. More info on the BLS Public Data API is available [here](https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm).

Neither I nor BLS.gov can vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data after the data have been retrieved from BLS.gov.

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4 or up. Get the module with `npm install cpiu` and use it with `var cpiu = require('cpiu');`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create a `.env` file with the environment variable `BLS_API_KEY`) and enter your BLS API key, which can be obtained [here](https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/).

## Usage

API documentation can be found [here](https://clpo13.github.io/cpiu).

Better documentation, including examples, is pending.
